## Python Scripts

with the intent of exploiting Linux features on Embedded target, we used a high-level language with support for reach frameworks with outstanding technologies, we decided to use `python` and its packages `openCV`, `paho-mqtt`, and `sub-process`. 

the following features are implemented by the contained Python scripts.

1. AI Locker with openCV
2. GPS Broadcast
3. GPIO 2-Way Communication
